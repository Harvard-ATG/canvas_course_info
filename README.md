A Harvard-specific Django LTI app that allows course authors to insert a 
"course information" widget containing live-updated course information from the registrar into 
any page with a rich content editor.

It replaces functionality formerly provided by isites.

Authors click an icon, which opens a widget editor window to let them choose
which fields they would like to include in the widget. The widget is then 
inserted into the page, and is live-updated using the icommons api.

See the docs directory for instructions on how to run locally and in heroku.
