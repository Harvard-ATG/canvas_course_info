## A Harvard-specific Django LTI app
**that allows course authors to insert their old course information into
the Canvas Rich Content Editor as a live-updating widget.**

Authors click an icon, which opens an editor window to let him/her choose
which fields he/she would like to include.

## See the docs directory for instructions on how to run this app locally and in Heroku.

### A Note on oEmbed:
An older version of this app allowed for insertion of course information as 
static html on the Canvas page via oEmbed; this was removed for the sake of
the maintainability of the code base as it was not being used.
